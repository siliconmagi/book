Silicon Revolution:

Throughout the generations man and woman undergo societal and technological changes we describe as revolutions. The word revolution is an interesting word that has multiple dimensions of meaning. It can mean a drastic political or social change or can mean the completion of a full rotation. Both these definitions have a perspective to offer in the revolution we find ourselves in today--the silicon revolution.

In many ways, we as a species, are ill prepared for the implications of a revolution whose speed is that of information. Therefore, it is imperative to be aggressive not only in informing oneself of the nature of the silicon revolution but also to act preemptively to benefit from change rather than to be overcome by it.

One such characteristic of the silicon revolution which is both impending and drastic in it's implications is the use of autonomous vehicles. To fully comprehend the effect which will take place not in the distant future but within two to five years will require one to examine the very heart of the American middle class. Currently the most popular job in the United States is by far the truck, delivery and tractor drivers. As of 2014 [1] it is the most popular job by state with 29 out of 51 states reporting it being their most common job. Largely, this is due to its insulation from the forces of globalization and automation, however this protection is already starting to show leaks. Uber is already testing autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh [2] as of this year 2016 and autonomous vehicles created by nuTonomy are expected to be used in Singapore via a production taxi service this year [3]. Furthermore, semi-autonomous driving is already available for the Tesla model S, BMW 750i, Infiniti Q50S and Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG [4].

It is important to understand the effect of autonomous cars will not be isolated to the community of human drivers but will effect the very fabric of the American economy. Those human drivers represent a large swath of middle class jobs and wages that will no longer be participating economically in the form of food, retail, housing and car purchases etc.

Autonomous vehicles will be one of many manifestations from the silicon revolution. The silicon revolution will continue to disrupt humanity socially, economically and morally. A disruption this all encompassing can be considered a completion of a cycle bringing humanity back to it's origins--confronting it's very existence. The question is does one idle and allow the silicon revolution to disrupt or does one act preemptively to benefit from impending changes?
