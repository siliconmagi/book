Time for another facebook fireside chat. Today we talk about how to respect one's country. Respect means to have a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements. Common forms of respect include physical gestures like standing during a song or in the presence of some official and also supporting the statements of officials. When respect and admiration are used, it is often assumed that the entity being admired has qualities that are reasonably moral. However, this is not necessarily the case and it is not only possible but likely that one admires an entity that is immoral. To admire an immoral entity is easy because it does not require one to be moral, informed and reasonable. It is easy to do what everyone else is doing and it is easy to accept naively, some explanation without evaluation or rigorous testing. To admire a truly moral entity requires one to be informed, be reasonable and practice morality so that those entities which receive admiration have undergone rigorous evaluation with results confirming a moral nature. Without proper moral evaluation of entities prior to admiration, one is infact disrespecting oneself and one's country by supporting an indifference to morality. A country that is indifferent to morality is one that does not respect itself or the individuals who compose it. Therefore, to respect one's country is to not give admiration loosely but for admiration to be given backup up by informed reasoning and rigorous moral selection.
